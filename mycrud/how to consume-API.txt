Consume API in Angular:

import httpclientModule in module.ts file as follows

import {HttpClientModule} from '@angular/common/http';

STEP 1:
create model class (ng g class)
 define properties of class (databse ky tables ma jo column han unko define krna hai)
 this model class have multiple classes for each table

STEP 2:
 create service (ng g service)
 import {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';
 in constructor create variable any name of your choice and have type HttpClient
 in my case this is http  (public http:HttpClient);

 in service we have to create method for post, put, delete and get

GET:
 get method have observable return type which is imported from rxjs library 
 import {Observable} from 'rxjs';

 example of get method:
   getAll(): Observable<Usermodel[]> {
    return this.http.get<Usermodel[]>(this.baseUrl);

POST:
post method have just url and data
this.http.post(url,data)

PUT:
put method have id so we have to give url and id
put(url/id,data)

DELETE:
delete method usually have only one data or item so we have to pass id as a parameter
detele(id)
this.http.detele(url/id)

STEP 3:
Now in component.ts file
we have to inject our service and call these methods
